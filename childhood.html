	<p> <h3 style="white;">I was born on April 20th of 1999 in Orlando, Florda. We soon moved to my dads home town of Auburn, Maine to be close to our family business. I was a very happy kid with tons of energy and love to give out.  Later on I would be introduced to hockey and where my jounrey started.  From there I meet long time friends and many life lessons as I got out of my confort zone.  Every weekend my dad or mom would take my to my games all around new england.  Thats where I found my passion.</h3></p>
