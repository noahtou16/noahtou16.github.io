<center> <p>As I got older I realized that the public school system didnt fit me well so I decided to go to my home town catholic school, Saint Dominic Academy.  There I was taught how to become an exception student with great study habits and mindset for success.  Also the schools hockey program is historic, with 25 state championships (3rd most in the country). I helped the team get to 2 state champion ships and being top 4 in state every year.
